# TemplateWorkshopEx



Purpose of the workshop is to learn how to utilize templates. 

Templates are super vesatile. Once you create a template, the datatypes are t. 

Creating the function should be outside int main() performing tasks.

Inside Main() you create new variables (which serve as obj) and make it equal to the function(x, y).

You can cout the variable name to see the result.
